## 🔥 About Me

**I'm now a Ph.D. candidate of School of Electronics, Peking University under the supervision of *[Prof. Xiang Cheng (IEEE Fellow)](http://pcni.pku.edu.cn/homepage.html)*. I am a group member of *[Pervasive Connectivity and Networked Intelligence (PCNI)](http://pcni.pku.edu.cn/homepage.html)*. My Google Scholar link is *[here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Vph0sK0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)*.**

**My research interests include Multi-modal Sensing-Communication Integration Aided Transceiver Design**: Explore how to effectively utilize multi-modal sensing to assist in transceiver design, e.g., proactive beamforming, channel estimation, and precoding design.
